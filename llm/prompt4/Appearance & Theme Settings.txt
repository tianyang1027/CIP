Step type: Appearance & Theme Settings

Purpose:
- Validate appearance/theme related behaviors (Light/Dark/System theme, page theme, UI theme, colors, backgrounds) using provided evidence.
- Prefer visual evidence (screenshots/video frames). Avoid assumptions about what theme is active unless it is clearly indicated.

Allowed decision outputs (MUST use exactly one):
- Correct, Incorrect, NeedDiscussion, Spam.

Spam (override):
- Select Spam only if the evidence is clearly irrelevant to appearance/theme settings (unrelated apps/pages) or is duplicate/no-action evidence with no attempt to demonstrate theme/appearance behavior.

Zero-inference policy:
- Judge only what is visible in the evidence.
- Do not infer the OS theme or browser theme from vague colors alone if the UI is cropped/unclear.
- Do not assume a toggle was changed unless the before/after state is shown.

Common scopes for this step (map the step intent to one; if unclear → NeedDiscussion):
1) Theme selection: switching Light/Dark/System (or equivalent) in settings.
2) UI appearance: browser UI or app chrome changes (toolbars, menus, frame colors).
3) Page appearance: page content theme changes (background/text contrast) due to theme.
4) Persistence: theme remains after refresh/reopen/new tab.
5) High-level appearance options: font size, page zoom, layout density, backgrounds (only if the step explicitly targets them).

Evidence requirements:
- For theme selection: must show the setting control and the selected state (radio/toggle/selected option).
- For verifying change: must show a before/after pair (or sequence) where the UI/page appearance is visibly different AND consistent with the chosen theme.
- For persistence: must show evidence after refresh/reopen/new tab (sequence), not just a single frame.
- If the setting area or the resulting UI is too cropped/blurry to confirm the state → NeedDiscussion.

Key definitions:
- Light/Dark/System: any explicit theme selector indicating which theme is active.
- Visible change: clear, unambiguous change to UI/page that corresponds to a theme switch (not just slight rendering differences).
- Persistence: the selected theme remains applied after a navigation or restart action shown in evidence.

Judging rubric:

Correct when:
- The step’s intended scope is clearly demonstrated by evidence, AND
- The theme/appearance setting state is visible and unambiguous, AND
- The observed UI/page change matches the selected theme, OR the step intent is only to confirm the selector state (and it is clearly shown), AND
- If persistence is required, the after-action state is shown and consistent.

Incorrect if ANY are true (based on evidence):
- The expected theme/appearance control is missing where the step claims it exists.
- The selected theme shown does not match the required one.
- The before/after does not show the claimed change, or shows the opposite.
- Persistence is required but evidence shows the theme reverted or did not apply.

NeedDiscussion when:
- The step intent is about theme/appearance but evidence does not show the setting state or a meaningful before/after.
- Evidence is ambiguous (cropped/blurry; cannot confirm selected option or resulting UI).
- The step mixes multiple goals (theme + unrelated settings) without sufficient evidence for each.

Spam when:
- Evidence is irrelevant to theme/appearance or contains no meaningful attempt.

Decision tree (apply in order):
0) Spam override: irrelevant/duplicate/no-action → Spam.
1) Scope match: if step intent cannot be mapped to the scopes above → NeedDiscussion.
2) Evidence sufficiency:
	- Selector-state tasks: need clear screenshot of the selector and selected value.
	- Change verification tasks: need before/after showing change.
	- Persistence tasks: need sequence after refresh/reopen.
	If not met → NeedDiscussion.
3) Evaluate:
	- If required state/change is shown and consistent → Correct.
	- If state/change is clearly wrong/missing/reverted → Incorrect.

Strong tie-breakers:
- If you cannot clearly see the selected theme option, do not guess based on page colors; return NeedDiscussion.
- If the only evidence is a single screenshot of a page (no settings UI, no before/after) and the step claims a theme change, default to NeedDiscussion.

Suggested capture guidance (what to ask for when NeedDiscussion):
- Capture the settings page showing the theme selector with the chosen option highlighted.
- Capture a before/after of the same page area (or browser UI) to show the change.
- If testing persistence, capture after refresh (Ctrl+R) or reopen sequence with the theme still applied.
