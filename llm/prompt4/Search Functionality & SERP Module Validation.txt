Step type: Search Functionality & SERP Module Validation

Purpose:
- Validate search behavior and SERP modules (query input, results loading, specific modules/cards, filtering, pagination) using provided evidence.
- Prefer visual evidence (screenshots/video frames). Do not infer what query was submitted unless shown.

Allowed decision outputs (MUST use exactly one):
- Correct, Incorrect, NeedDiscussion, Spam.

Spam (override):
- Select Spam only if the evidence is clearly unrelated to search/SERP (unrelated apps/pages) or is duplicate/no-action evidence with no attempt to search.

Zero-inference policy:
- Judge only what is visible.
- Do not assume a query was executed unless the SERP shows the query term in the search box/page header or results clearly correspond.
- Do not assume a module exists if it is off-screen; do not assume scrolling happened unless shown.
- Do not infer ranking correctness beyond visible evidence.

Common scopes for this step (map step intent to one or more; if unclear → NeedDiscussion):
1) Query submission: entering a query and triggering search.
2) Results load: SERP loads successfully (no error/blank/infinite spinner).
3) Module presence: a specific SERP module/card appears (e.g., Knowledge panel, News, Images, Videos, Map/Local pack, Weather, Shopping, Related searches).
4) Module correctness: module content matches the query intent (at a basic, visible level).
5) Filters/tabs: switching All/Images/News/Videos or applying filters changes results as expected.
6) Pagination/infinite scroll: loading more results works.

Evidence requirements:
- Must show the submitted query (search box showing the query text, or a visible “Results for …” indicator).
- Must show the resulting SERP state:
  - For module presence/correctness: the module must be visible in-frame.
  - For filters/tabs: show before/after or selected tab state.
  - For pagination: show next page loaded or additional results appended.
- If key text/module labels are cropped/blurry and cannot be read → NeedDiscussion.

Key definitions:
- SERP: the search engine results page.
- Module/card: a distinct results block (e.g., Top stories, map pack, image grid).
- Loaded successfully: results and/or modules are visible without error overlays.
- Broken search: error page, no results due to failure, infinite loading, blocked by consent modal that prevents results.

Judging rubric:

Correct when:
- The step’s intended search/SERP scope is clearly demonstrated by evidence, AND
- The query is visible, AND
- The expected module/behavior (results load, module appears, filter changes) is visible and matches the requirement, AND
- No contradictory evidence is shown.

Incorrect if ANY are true (based on evidence):
- Search results do not load when they should (error/blank/infinite spinner) and the step expects a working SERP.
- The expected SERP module is missing when it is required and evidence shows the relevant area (not just off-screen).
- Filter/tab/pagination action does not take effect when it should (selected state changes but results do not; or cannot change at all).
- The SERP clearly corresponds to a different query than required (query mismatch shown).

NeedDiscussion when:
- The query is not visible in evidence.
- The required module area is not shown (could be off-screen) and there is no scroll evidence.
- Evidence is ambiguous (cropped/blurry; cannot confirm module label or selected tab).
- The step intent is unclear (which module, which query, which expected behavior).

Spam when:
- Evidence is irrelevant to search/SERP or contains no meaningful attempt.

Decision tree (apply in order):
0) Spam override: irrelevant/duplicate/no-action → Spam.
1) Scope match: if step intent cannot be mapped to scopes above → NeedDiscussion.
2) Evidence sufficiency:
	- Query must be visible.
	- Required module/tab/filter must be visible.
	If not met → NeedDiscussion.
3) Evaluate:
	- If required SERP behavior/module is clearly satisfied → Correct.
	- If required behavior/module is clearly missing/broken/mismatched → Incorrect.

Strong tie-breakers:
- If the query string is not visible, do not assume; return NeedDiscussion.
- If the module could be off-screen and there is no scroll evidence, return NeedDiscussion.

Suggested capture guidance (for NeedDiscussion):
- Capture the search box showing the query and the top of the SERP.
- If validating a module lower on the page, capture scrolled views showing that module.
- For filters/tabs, capture before and after switching tabs with the selected tab clearly highlighted.
