Step type: Environment & Precondition Setup

Purpose:
- Validate that required environment and preconditions for a test are correctly set up (browser/app state, network, account state, locale, permissions, starting page) using provided evidence.
- This step is about readiness. If the precondition is not met, downstream functional checks should not be judged as passing.

Allowed decision outputs (MUST use exactly one):
- Correct, Incorrect, NeedDiscussion, Spam.

Spam (override):
- Select Spam only if the evidence is clearly irrelevant to setup/preconditions (unrelated apps/pages) or is duplicate/no-action evidence with no attempt to establish the required setup.

Zero-inference policy:
- Judge only what is visible.
- Do not assume environment state (VPN on/off, account signed in, locale, permissions) unless a clear UI indicator is shown.
- Do not assume “setup completed” from step text alone.

Common precondition types (map the step intent to one or more; if unclear → NeedDiscussion):
1) App/browser readiness: correct app open, correct version/channel, browser window visible.
2) Start state: correct starting URL/page, new tab state, cleared cache/cookies, incognito/InPrivate mode.
3) Account state: signed in/out, correct profile selected, required subscription/license.
4) Permissions: notifications/location/camera/mic/popups/clipboard/downloads permission set.
5) Network: connectivity, VPN/proxy required/disabled, captive portal absent.
6) Locale/time: language/region, time zone, units.
7) Device/OS: OS setting prerequisite (only if explicitly required).

Evidence requirements:
- Must show the relevant UI indicator(s) confirming the precondition.
	Examples: address bar with starting URL; settings page showing toggle state; profile menu indicating signed-in/out; permission prompt showing allowed/blocked; locale setting page showing language.
- If the precondition involves “clean state” (cleared cookies/cache), require either explicit UI showing cleared data action or a fresh first-run-like state that is unambiguous.
- If evidence is cropped/blurry and the prerequisite cannot be confirmed → NeedDiscussion.

Key definitions:
- Precondition satisfied: the required setup state is visible and matches the step’s requirement.
- Precondition not satisfied: evidence contradicts the required setup (wrong URL, wrong mode, wrong account state, missing permission).
- Blocker: an unexpected modal/error/network issue prevents establishing the precondition.

Judging rubric:

Correct when:
- The required precondition(s) are clearly visible in evidence and match the requested setup.

Incorrect if ANY are true (based on evidence):
- Required precondition is clearly not met (e.g., wrong starting page, wrong mode, wrong account state, permission not set as required).
- A blocker is shown that prevents setup completion (e.g., network error page, crash, policy block) and the step requires setup completion.

NeedDiscussion when:
- Evidence does not show the prerequisite indicators (only text).
- Evidence is ambiguous (cropped/blurry; cannot confirm URL/toggle/account state).
- The step describes multiple preconditions but evidence covers only part.
- The step intent is unclear or not actually about environment/setup.

Spam when:
- Evidence is irrelevant or contains no meaningful attempt.

Decision tree (apply in order):
0) Spam override: irrelevant/duplicate/no-action → Spam.
1) Scope match: if step intent cannot be mapped to precondition types above → NeedDiscussion.
2) Evidence sufficiency: if required indicators are not visible/readable → NeedDiscussion.
3) Evaluate:
	 - If all required preconditions are visibly satisfied → Correct.
	 - If any required precondition is visibly violated or setup is blocked → Incorrect.

Strong tie-breakers:
- Prefer NeedDiscussion over guessing when the only evidence is a generic page screenshot without the relevant setup indicators.
- Do not treat “looks like the right page” as proof; require readable URL/labels.

Suggested capture guidance (for NeedDiscussion):
- Include a screenshot showing the starting URL (address bar) and any required mode indicator (e.g., InPrivate) if applicable.
- Include the exact settings/permission page showing the required toggle or selection.
- Include the profile/account menu showing signed-in/out and selected profile state.
