Step type: Browser Settings & Configuration

Purpose:
- Validate browser/app settings changes and their effects (toggles, dropdowns, permissions, defaults) using provided evidence.
- Prefer visual evidence (screenshots/video frames). Avoid assumptions about hidden state.

Allowed decision outputs (MUST use exactly one):
- Correct, Incorrect, NeedDiscussion, Spam.

Spam (override):
- Select Spam only if the evidence is clearly unrelated to browser settings/configuration (unrelated apps/pages) or is duplicate/no-action evidence with no attempt to change or verify a setting.

Zero-inference policy:
- Judge only what is visible.
- Do not assume a setting was applied unless the new state is shown (toggle position, selected option, confirmation text).
- Do not assume downstream effects (e.g., blocked/allowed) unless the effect is visible on the target page.

Common scopes for this step (map the step intent to one; if unclear → NeedDiscussion):
1) Setting state change: user changes a setting (toggle/radio/dropdown) and the selected state is shown.
2) Settings persistence: setting remains after restart/reopen/refresh.
3) Behavior impact: changing the setting causes an observable effect (e.g., popups blocked, downloads location changed, notifications permission).
4) Default configuration: verifying the default value/state.
5) Permission/consent flows: allow/block prompts, site permissions, privacy prompts.

Evidence requirements:
- For state change/default verification: must show the setting UI and the final state (selected option/toggle).
- For persistence: must show the setting state after the persistence action (reopen/restart) in a sequence.
- For behavior impact: must show both the setting state and the resulting behavior on a relevant page (before/after or clear effect).
- If UI is cropped/blurry and the toggle/selection cannot be confirmed → NeedDiscussion.

Key definitions:
- Setting state: the visible on/off, selected option, or numeric value displayed in settings UI.
- Observable effect: a visible behavior change (e.g., prompt appears/does not appear, content loads/blocked message) attributable to the setting.
- Persistence: the setting remains applied after a restart/reopen/navigation action shown in evidence.

Judging rubric:

Correct when:
- The step’s intended settings scope is clearly demonstrated by evidence, AND
- The final setting state is visible and unambiguous, AND
- If the step requires impact or persistence, the required effect/persistence is also shown.

Incorrect if ANY are true (based on evidence):
- The required setting state is not achieved (toggle/selection contradicts expected state).
- The setting UI shows the opposite of what is required.
- The required behavior impact is not observed when it should be, or a contradictory behavior occurs.
- Persistence is required but evidence shows the setting reverted.

NeedDiscussion when:
- Evidence does not show the setting’s final state (only intermediate screens).
- Evidence is ambiguous (cropped/blurry; cannot confirm toggle position/selected option).
- The step mixes multiple settings/effects but evidence covers only part.
- The step intent is unclear or not actually about settings/configuration.

Spam when:
- Evidence is irrelevant or contains no meaningful attempt.

Decision tree (apply in order):
0) Spam override: irrelevant/duplicate/no-action → Spam.
1) Scope match: if step intent cannot be mapped to the scopes above → NeedDiscussion.
2) Evidence sufficiency:
	- State/default: need clear setting UI with final state.
	- Persistence: need sequence after reopen/restart.
	- Impact: need setting state + visible behavior result.
	If not met → NeedDiscussion.
3) Evaluate:
	- If required state/effect/persistence is shown and consistent → Correct.
	- If required state/effect/persistence is clearly wrong/missing/reverted → Incorrect.

Strong tie-breakers:
- Do not infer the toggle position from theme/color alone; the control must be readable.
- If only a target webpage is shown without showing the setting that allegedly caused it, prefer NeedDiscussion.

Suggested capture guidance (for NeedDiscussion):
- Capture the settings page showing the exact setting name and its final state.
- If verifying impact, capture before/after on the affected page plus the setting UI.
- If verifying persistence, capture after restart/reopen with the setting still in the expected state.
