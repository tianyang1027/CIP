Step type: Localization & Internationalization

Purpose:
- Validate localization (language/strings) and internationalization (region formats, RTL layout, currency/date/number units) using provided evidence.
- Prefer visual evidence (screenshots/video frames). Avoid guessing locale from vague cues.

Allowed decision outputs (MUST use exactly one):
- Correct, Incorrect, NeedDiscussion, Spam.

Spam (override):
- Select Spam only if the evidence is clearly unrelated to localization/i18n (unrelated apps/pages) or is duplicate/no-action evidence with no attempt to verify localized behavior.

Zero-inference policy:
- Judge only what is visible.
- Do not infer the active locale/language unless it is explicitly shown (settings selector, language label, URL parameter, or clearly localized UI labels).
- Do not assume translation quality beyond what is visible and legible.

Common scopes for this step (map step intent to one or more; if unclear → NeedDiscussion):
1) UI language: labels/menus/buttons appear in the expected language.
2) Region formats: date/time format, number separators, currency symbol/placement, measurement units.
3) Content localization: localized content strings, headings, error messages.
4) Layout direction: RTL/LTR behavior (alignment, navigation arrows, mirrored UI) when applicable.
5) Input/encoding: special characters, accent marks, non-Latin scripts render correctly.
6) Locale switching: changing language/region setting updates UI and persists.

Evidence requirements:
- For language correctness: must show the relevant UI text in the target area and it must be readable.
- For format correctness: must show the actual rendered values (date/number/currency) in context.
- For locale switching/persistence: must show before/after (or sequence) including the setting selector and resulting UI.
- If text/values are cropped/blurry and cannot be read → NeedDiscussion.

Key definitions:
- Expected locale/language: the target specified by the test step (e.g., French (fr-FR), German (de-DE), Arabic (ar-SA)).
- Format correctness: conforms to the expected locale conventions (e.g., decimal comma vs dot, 24h vs 12h, currency placement).
- RTL correctness: UI direction/alignments reflect RTL where required and do not break usability.

Judging rubric:

Correct when:
- The step’s intended localization scope is clearly demonstrated by evidence, AND
- The UI language/format/layout matches the expected locale/language requirements, AND
- If switching/persistence is required, the after-action state is shown and consistent.

Incorrect if ANY are true (based on evidence):
- The UI is clearly in the wrong language/locale for the step.
- Date/number/currency formatting is clearly inconsistent with the expected locale.
- Visible garbling/encoding issues (missing glyphs, tofu boxes, broken characters) in the relevant area.
- RTL is required but layout is clearly broken/unusable or direction is clearly wrong.
- Locale switching is required but does not apply or reverts (persistence fails).

NeedDiscussion when:
- Evidence does not show the relevant localized text/value/selector.
- Evidence is ambiguous (cropped/blurry; cannot confirm language or format).
- The step intent is unclear (language vs region vs translation vs RTL) or mixes multiple goals without enough evidence.

Spam when:
- Evidence is irrelevant to localization/i18n or contains no meaningful attempt.

Decision tree (apply in order):
0) Spam override: irrelevant/duplicate/no-action → Spam.
1) Scope match: if step intent cannot be mapped to scopes above → NeedDiscussion.
2) Evidence sufficiency:
	- Language/format/layout must be readable.
	- Switching/persistence requires before/after sequence.
	If not met → NeedDiscussion.
3) Evaluate:
	- If expected localized behavior is clearly met → Correct.
	- If expected behavior is clearly violated → Incorrect.

Strong tie-breakers:
- Do not guess locale from a flag icon or page theme colors; require readable language/region indicators.
- If only a single screenshot is provided and the step expects a locale switch/persistence, return NeedDiscussion.

Suggested capture guidance (for NeedDiscussion):
- Capture the language/region selector showing the chosen locale.
- Capture the same UI area after applying the setting, with key strings/values readable.
- For formats, include examples of date/time, currency, and numbers in the relevant screen.
- For RTL, capture a broader view showing alignment and navigation controls.
