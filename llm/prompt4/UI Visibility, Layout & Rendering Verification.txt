Step type: UI Visibility, Layout & Rendering Verification (final)

Purpose:
- Validate UI visibility and rendering correctness using the provided evidence: elements present/visible, layout alignment, overlap/clipping, truncation, responsive behavior, and broken rendering.
- Prefer visual evidence (screenshots/video frames). Do not infer off-screen content.

Allowed decision outputs (use exactly one):
- Correct, Incorrect, NeedDiscussion, Spam.

Context alignment rule (updated):
- The evidence must show the DUT/context described by the step (e.g., the Maps page with the overlay toolbar). If the evidence shows a different app/page (such as a browser welcome/onboarding screen) but is still a real UI capture, select NeedDiscussion—not Spam—because it is a valid capture but does not show the target UI area.
- Each step is validated by the evidence provided for that step only. Do not rely on prior steps or assumed context unless it is visible in the current capture.

Spam override — narrowed:
- Select Spam only if the evidence is clearly non-action or non-assessable for UI visibility/layout, such as:
  - Blank/black screen, desktop wallpaper with no app window, or camera/photo of a room.
  - Pure text logs/notes, terminal output, or unrelated media (memes, selfies, etc.).
  - Extreme crops with no discernible UI elements.
  - Duplicate/no-action evidence across submissions with no attempt to show any relevant UI.
- If a real app UI is shown (e.g., Microsoft Edge welcome page) but it is not the DUT, prefer NeedDiscussion over Spam.

Zero-inference policy:
- Judge only what is visible.
- Do not assume an element exists if it is off-screen or hidden.
- Do not assume scrolling/zoom/responsive changes occurred unless shown.

Common scopes for this step:
1) Element visibility: a specific UI element is present and visible (not hidden/covered).
2) Layout correctness: alignment, spacing, order, and positioning meet expectations.
3) Rendering integrity: no broken fonts/icons/images, no garbled text, no missing styles.
4) Overlap/clipping: elements do not overlap incorrectly; text is not truncated unexpectedly.
5) Responsive/layout breakpoints: UI adapts correctly at different window sizes/zoom levels.
6) Loading states: skeletons/spinners resolve to final UI (or remain stuck).

Evidence requirements:
- Must show the relevant UI area clearly and at sufficient zoom to judge visibility/layout.
- For responsive/zoom claims: show before/after with visible proof of a size/zoom change (different viewport width, zoom indicator, or noticeably different layout).
- For loading-state claims: provide time-separated frames showing completion or persistent loading.
- If the relevant element/text is cropped/blurry or the evidence shows the wrong app/page context, select NeedDiscussion.
- The DUT/context (e.g., Maps page with overlay toolbar and hurricane icon) must be visible in the capture to allow assessment; textual assertions are insufficient.

Judging rubric:
- Correct when:
  - The step’s intended UI visibility/layout/rendering scope is clearly demonstrated in the correct context (e.g., Maps page with overlay toolbar).
  - Required elements (e.g., hurricane icon and map content) are visible as expected and unobscured.
  - No clear layout/rendering defects are shown in the relevant area.
  - If responsive/loading behavior is required, evidence shows it behaving correctly.
- Incorrect when (in the correct context):
  - The required element is missing or not visible when it should be.
  - The element is present but obscured by an overlay/modal/banner that should not block it.
  - Clear layout defect (overlap, clipping, severe truncation, broken alignment).
  - Clear rendering defect (missing styles, broken icons/fonts, missing images where expected).
  - Loading is stuck (spinner/skeleton persists) when the step expects final UI.
- NeedDiscussion when:
  - Evidence does not show the relevant UI area or element (wrong app/page/context, cropped/blurry, insufficient zoom).
  - The step intent is unclear or mixes multiple UI areas but evidence covers only part.
  - Example: A screenshot of the Microsoft Edge welcome page when the step targets clicking the Hurricane icon on the Maps overlay → NeedDiscussion.
- Spam when:
  - Evidence is irrelevant or contains no meaningful attempt as defined in the narrowed Spam override.

Decision tree (apply in order):
0) Spam override: If the capture meets the narrowed Spam criteria → Spam. Otherwise proceed.
1) Scope/context match: If the DUT/context is not shown or the intent cannot be mapped to the scopes above → NeedDiscussion.
2) Evidence sufficiency: If the relevant UI area is not visible/readable → NeedDiscussion.
3) Evaluate (in correct context):
   - If required UI visibility/layout/rendering is clearly correct → Correct.
   - If clear missing/obscured/broken layout/rendering/stuck loading → Incorrect.

Strong tie-breakers:
- If you cannot see the target element in the correct context, do not guess; return NeedDiscussion.
- Use Incorrect only when the correct context is visible and the requirement fails.
- Minor cosmetic differences should not be treated as failures unless the step explicitly requires pixel-perfect behavior.

Suggested capture guidance (for NeedDiscussion):
- Capture a wider view showing context plus a close-up showing the target element.
- If testing responsiveness, capture two window sizes/zoom levels with the same UI area.
- If testing loading, capture two frames separated by a few seconds showing whether it resolved.
