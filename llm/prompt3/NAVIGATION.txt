Step type: Single-page web navigation — Open a desktop web browser (e.g., Microsoft Edge/Chrome/Firefox), go to a specified URL, and click a named tab/link on that site.

Purpose:
- Validate that the tester opens a browser, navigates to the given domain/URL, and activates the specified site navigation element (e.g., a top navigation tab).
- Success is achieved when the target tab/link is clicked and its corresponding page/content is displayed or the tab shows an active/selected state.

Applicability (apply this rule when at least one of the following is true):
- The instruction mentions opening Edge/Chrome/Firefox and navigating to a specific URL or domain (e.g., https://msn.com/money).
- The instruction includes clicking a named site navigation element (e.g., a top tab like "Ma liste de valeurs", "Finance").
- Localized labels for the site/tab are provided (e.g., French: "Ma liste de valeurs").

Do NOT apply this rule (classify under other rules or mark Spam/out-of-scope for this rule) when:
- The instruction is about Windows Settings navigation (e.g., open Settings and go to Personalization) — use the Windows Settings rule.
- The instruction targets non-browser OS surfaces (File Explorer, Start menu without opening a browser, Widgets, desktop) or third-party native apps.

Required actions for in-scope steps:
- Open the specified browser.
- Navigate to the specified URL or clearly equivalent localized path on the same domain (e.g., msn.com may redirect to https://www.msn.com/fr-fr/finance/liste-de-valeurs for French locale).
- Click the specified tab/link in the site’s navigation so its page becomes active/visible.

Acceptable variations:
- URL differences due to locale or redirects (http/https, www, regional/language segments, trailing slashes).
- Different supported browsers (Edge/Chrome/Firefox) and minor UI differences.
- The tab/link label may be localized but matches the instruction intent.

Evidence to verify success:
- The screenshot shows a browser window with an address bar displaying the correct domain (e.g., msn.com) and a relevant path (e.g., /money, /finance, /liste-de-valeurs).
- The specified tab/link (e.g., "Ma liste de valeurs") is clearly visible and appears active/selected (highlighted, underlined) OR the page header/content corresponds to that tab (e.g., watchlist page).

Classification outcomes:
- Correct:
  - The browser is open to the correct site/domain and the specified tab/link is active/selected, with matching page content.
- Incorrect:
  - The browser is open but on the wrong site or wrong page; the specified tab/link is not visible or not active; the content does not match the target.
- NeedDiscussion:
  - The screenshot is too cropped or ambiguous to confirm the URL/domain or the tab selection state; navigation element not clearly identifiable.
- Spam (out-of-scope for this rule):
  - Non-browser surfaces (Windows Settings, File Explorer, desktop) or unrelated tasks.

Decision checklist (strict):
- Does the step mention a browser and a target URL/domain? If yes, apply this rule.
- Is a browser window with an address bar visible, showing the correct domain? If yes, proceed.
- Is the named tab/link visible and appears active OR does the page header/content match the target? If yes, mark Correct; if not, mark Incorrect.
- If the image is ambiguous (URL/tab not confirmable), mark NeedDiscussion.

Image cues for quick identification:
- Browser chrome with address bar (Edge/Chrome/Firefox).
- Site navigation bar with tab labels; active tab often highlighted or underlined (e.g., "Ma liste de valeurs").
- Page header/content consistent with the selected tab (e.g., watchlist/"Liste de valeurs").

Common pitfalls to avoid:
- Do not misclassify browser pages under Windows Settings.
- Allow for localized URLs and tab labels; verify intent via domain and visible content.
- Ensure the tab is actually active, not merely visible.

Goal reinforcement:
- Treat successful navigation to the specified URL and activation of the named site tab/link as Correct, even if locale-based redirects alter the path, as long as the domain and page content align with the instruction.
